        "Popcorn is a popular snack made from dried corn kernels that puff up when heated. It is typically prepared by placing the kernels in a pot or popcorn machine with a little oil, then heating it over high heat. As the heat increases, the water inside the kernels turns into steam, creating pressure within the kernel. Eventually, the pressure becomes too much for the outer shell, causing it to burst open, turning the kernel inside out and forming a fluffy, edible snack. Popcorn is often enjoyed plain or seasoned with salt, butter, or various flavors like caramel or cheese. It is a popular choice for movie nights, parties, and a quick and satisfying snack option."
